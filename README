# Google Maps Stub

Creating google maps based applications is fun!  I created this little google maps stub to help me TDD when working on google maps based applications.

### Example usage

		var google = new GoogleMapsMock();
		var mapviewmodel = new MapViewModel(google);
		mapviewmodel.setup();

		equal(google.results.MapResults.id, "#test", "Correct map canvas is used");

Easy as that.  There is also an example folder with a test based on QUnit.

Only the basic functionality is covered at the moment but I will add new functions as I need them. Some of the features currently covered are:

- Map
- Traffic Layer
- DirectionsService
- DirectionsRendered
- LatLng
- Places Autocomplete
